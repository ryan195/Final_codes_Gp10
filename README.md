<h3> Project Motivation </h3>
This project aims to predict the potential presence of heart related diseases in patients accurately based on other variables available such as the past medical histories, age, general physical and mental health, and more.
Key risk indicators of heart related diseases identified from the predictions can be used to raise awareness among the public such that they are able to practise their own form of preventive measures. 

<h3> Models used </h3>
Using Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, XGB Classifier, 
Random Forest Classifier and Voting Class Ensemble on heart_2020_encoded.csv 
along with imbalanced data handling using SMOTE and SMOTEENN and Class Weighing </br>

XGB Classifier is used as the final model for hyperparameter tuning.


As such, we are proud to propose!
